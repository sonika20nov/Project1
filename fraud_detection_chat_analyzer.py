'''Model Loading: pipeline('sentiment-analysis') initializes a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to classify text into sentiment categories with confidence scores.

Sentiment Analysis Function: analyze_sentiment(text) uses the model to get sentiment labels and scores for the given text input.

Fraud Detection Logic: detect_fraudulent_behavior(messages) scans each message for predefined suspicious phrases and flags them if detected.

Sentiment Reporting: The script prints each messageâ€™s sentiment label and score, indicating its emotional tone and confidence level.
